    Executive Summary - Q4 2023 Board Review
    
    PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS:
    Despite challenging market conditions, we exceeded revenue targets by 8%. 
    Customer retention improved significantly to 92%, and our new product line 
    showed promising early adoption rates.
    
    CONCERNS AND CHALLENGES:
    However, we face several headwinds: rising operational costs, increased 
    competition in key markets, and potential economic recession impacts. 
    The recent supply chain disruptions cost us approximately $200K in Q4.
    
    STRATEGIC OUTLOOK:
    We remain optimistic about our long-term prospects but acknowledge the need 
    for more aggressive cost management. The board has approved a comprehensive 
    restructuring plan that may result in workforce reductions.
    
    FINANCIAL POSITION:
    While cash flow remains positive, we're concerned about declining margins. 
    The board is considering additional funding options to support growth initiatives.
